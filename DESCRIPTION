Title: Bayesian Data Reconciliation of Separation Processes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Scott Koermer <skoermer@vt.edu>
Maintainer: Scott Koermer <skoermer@vt.edu>
Description: Bayesian tools that can be used to reconcile, or mass balance, mass flow rate data collected from chemical or particulate separation processes aided by constraints governed by the conservation of mass.
    Functions included in the package aid the user in organizing and constraining data, using MCMC methods to obtain samples from Bayesian models, and in computation of the marginal likelihood of the data, given a particular model, for model selection.
