Title: Bayesian Data Reconciliation of Chemical and Particulate Processes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Scott Koermer <skoermer@vt.edu>
Maintainer: Scott Koermer <skoermer@vt.edu>
Description: This package gives Bayesian tools that can be used to reconscile, or mass balance, data collected from chemical or physical separation processes at steady state.
    Functions included in the package aid the user in organizing data, the user to fit Bayesian linearly constrained models, and compute Bayes Factors for model selection.
